# SGD_Collection
### 78.4% accuracy
A collection of 10 Stochastic Gradient Descent models from Scikit learn used to classify the MNIST data set.

# SGD_Ensemble
### 83.7% accuracy
The same collection of SGD models as in SGD_Collection but with and added feature of Eulers Number and the decision is made by a SGD model trained on all 11 features.
